              <h3> What's the best wine? </h3>

            There is no best wine. There's only the best wine for you, and I would even
            hazard to guess that there's probably not <em>one</em> best wine for you,
            but lots of best wines for you.</p>

            <p class="home"> So why, then, does it seem like everyone who's anyone in wine takes
              wine, and themselves, so seriously<a href="#">*</a>?
            </p>
            <p class="home"> I'm not an expert about wine. I was the wine manager in a decently sized
              liquor store (that shall remain nameless) for three years and that's when I
              I acquired a lot of my "formal" knowledge, but I did it in the same way I've
              explored any of my interests throughout my life: I Googled it!
            </p>
            <p class="home"> I read blogs, read books, read Wikipedia pages, listened to podcasts.
              I talked to other people about wine, experts and newbies alike, and I drank. A fair bit.
            </p>
            <p class="home">In the wine world we call it "tasting" and it's really the best way to learn about wine,
              and what all of those, seemingly, esorteric wine terms mean. What does <em> oaky </em> taste like?
              Does it taste like licking a tree? (Answer: somtimes, but usually not.) What's the
              <em> Old world </em> is it better than <em> New World </em>? What's the deal with <em>legs</em>?
            <p class="home">
            <p class="home"> This is a culmination of all of my research, and general nerdiness, about all things wine.
              So once you've had enough, if you're old enough wherever you live, close the computer, put
              the phone back in your pocket, get off the couch, and head to your nearest wine shop, and start
              tasting.
