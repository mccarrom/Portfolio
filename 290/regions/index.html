                  Italy is the largest producer of wine in the world, by volume. They mostly
                  produce wines with indigenous grapes including the big ones: Sangiovese and Nebbiolo.
                  White wine wise Italy is known for Pinot Grigio, most prolifically, but there are many
                  other white Italian wines worth your attention. Some of my favorites include Gavi di Gavi,
                  Vermentino di Sardegnia, and Verdichio. Italy, like France, labels their wines by where
                  they are grown (appellation) as opposed to what grape is in the bottle (varietal.) With
                  the appelation on the bottle, you, the cultured wine consumer is suppose to just <em> know </em>
                  what grapes are grown there and make up the wine.

                  Spain is the third largest wine growing region in the world, and
                  the largest, if we're going by geographical area. Despite the size
                  of its production, Spain doesn't have nearly the same recognition and/or
                  reputation as Italy and France do, in the US. That's good news for
                  the Spanish wine consumer though because it means that Spain is the place
                  to go for <em>VALUE</em> in wine. If I'm spending less than $10 on a bottle
                  of wine, you can bet it will be from Spain; and don't even get me started on
                  Cava. Cava is Spanish sparkling wine; it is made in the same method as Champagne
                  and therefore has the same fine, soft bubbles as Champagne, but uses indigenous
                  grapes to Spain. Flavor wise, Cava and Champagne are pretty similar, much more
                  so than Champagne and the well-known inexpensive dupe Prosecco. Cava is such a
                  tiny fraction of the price of Champagne; for my birthday last year I had a top
                  tier Cava from 10 years ago and it cost just over $60, Champagne of that quality
                  would cost over $100. You have my permission to pillage your wine shop's Spanish
                  section.

                  Spain is rivaled for value in Europe only by Portugal. Portugal
                  is so much more than Port, the sweet, fortified dessert wine it’s
                  famous for. Picture this: i’s a 200 degree day with 500% humidity
                  in the middle of July. You aren’t sure where your body ends and
                  your chair begins the leather has fused so firmly to your skin.
                  You are parched. Crack open a crispy, refreshing, slightly effervescent
                  Vinho Verde from Portugal. You will chug that down in no time, and feel
                  1000% better. It won’t matter that you weren’t able to savor the wine
                  either, Vinho Verde cost about $5 a bottle!

                  Portugal is going to become your new best friend.

                  Germany makes so much more than Riesling, but their Rieslings are transcendent.
                  Germany is very cold as far as wine-growing regions are concerned which means
                  certain grapes are likely to flourish there. Riesling is the most well known
                  followed by the recognizeable Gewurztraminer, which is only recognizeable because
                  of the unpronounceability of its name. Within the last ten years Germany has begun
                  producing some top tier Pinot Noir. To my palate it rivals good Burgundy,  but is
                  a touch smokier.

                  Gruner Veltliner and Blaufrankish are the two wines Austria is most well-known for.
                  Gruner is a sharp, acidic, mineral white, that is super refreshing and perfect
                  for roasted vegetables with brown caramelized bits. Blaufrankish is an indigenous
                  red grape that is like if Pinot Noir and Gamay had a super funky baby. Most of the
                  words in that sentence might not have meant anything to you, in which case, you need

                  I really love Greek wine and wish more people drank it. Many of the reds, mostly
                  made from indigenous grapes, can rival high quality Italian red wines, at a
                  fraction of the price (and self-importance) but my true love is Greek white wines.
                  You will see people (including myself) talk about minerality in wine. Usually,
                  mineral notes are a result of the elements of the soil where the wine is grown, known
                  as the <em> terrior </em> but some wines have a mineral salinity to them for a completely
                  different, and fascinating reason. Greek wine grapes, in the Mediterranean, and others
                  grown in similar circumstances, are at the mercy of the Atlantic Ocean. Ocean breezes blow
                  salt onto the grapes, from the ocean, influencing the flavors of the final wine.

                  Americans drink a lot of American wine. The United States
                  is the fourth largest wine producing region in the world.
                  It's hard to think that just over 40 years ago American wine, Californian
                  particularly, was seen as a complete joke on the world's stage.
                  There was a dramatic competition called "The Judgement of Paris"
                  where California wines were tasted blind by a panel of
                   experts, against the best wines France had to offer.
                  Spoiler alert: California beat France for the top prize
                  both in Reds (Cabernet Sauvignon Stags Leap Cellars)
                  and Whites (Chardonnay from Chateau Montelena.)
                  Now California is synonymous with quality American wine,
                   but many of them come with the price tag to match.
                  <br><br>
                  If you like the California style of wine try exploring
                  wines from Washington State, Argentina, and Chile.
                  If you find California wines too intense I would suggest
                  trying something from the Willamette Valley in Oregon, to start.

                  Argentina isn't all about Malbec. That being said, it's mostly about
                  Malbec. Malbec put Argentine wine on the map in this country when
                  Australian Shiraz was first falling out of favor. Americans wanted a
                  medium to full bodied, fruit forward wine, that wasn't <em> sweet </em>
                  per say, but wasn't tannic and intimidating either. Enter:Malbec.
                  <br><br>
                  If you're looking to branch out of Malbec, Argentina makes some great Syrah, Pinot
                  Noir, and Cabernet Sauvignon in a style very similar to many Californian producers
                  but at half of the price. On the white wine front you can find some bargain unoaked
                  Chardonnay, but the real star of the white wine scene in Argentina is Torrontes, a light,
                  acidic, salty, minerally, green wine that's perfect with lighter fare, or on a brutally
                  hot day.

                  Chile and Argentina are competitors and I am far from unbiased in the fight. That
                  being said, I would argue that Chile is a better value than Argentine wine nowadays.
                  The styles are very similar. Although, if you're a fan of red wines with green flavors,
                  Argentina doesn't really have anything to compare to Chilean Carménère. Chilean wines
                  are cheap, to the point that many bargain producers that use to source their juice from
                  American vineyards, now source it from Chile; and nobody noticed.

                  I say failed, but Pinotage really is more of a happy accident. It's slightly softer,
                  and fruitier, than Pinot Noir, and a wine that put South Africa on the mad. As Malbec is
