             <p>There are over 10,000 grape varieties in the world from which people make wine.
                The ones listed here are a very, very, small sampling of that selection. Below you
                will find what we call the<em> 18 Noble Grapes, </em> which are the most widely
                planted grapes, globally. Most of them are French. I'm not 100% sure of who decided
                that these were the Nobelest of Grapes when some really awesome grapes, like Mouvedre/Monastrell,
                Carménère, Torrontes, not to mention all of the grapes which are idigenous to different countries
                that also make world class wine, but don't bother with the French stuff, but I digress. For our
                purposes we had to limit the scope to these varietals. If you want to learn more about grapes you
                don't see listed here, check out the <a href="../regions/index.html">Regions</a>
                page. The specific descriptions aren't as comprehensive but we can talk about wines from
                a broader selection of grapes. For now, click on a heading below to explore these grapes

                            One of the lightest red wines around (although some of the high
                            octane ones from California and other warm weather climates might
                            have you believing otherwise) Pinot Noir is the grape that is among
                            the most expensive wine in the world, Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, aka DRC.
                            As a grape Pinot Noir is very finicky, also contributing to its increased cost.
                            French Pinot Noir comes from a region called Burgundy.
                            Burgundies are light, acidic reds that can have a bit of earthy
                            funk to them. Generally you'll  find notes of cherry and other
                            red fruits usually accompanied with a light woodiness. In the
                            United States California and Oregon are the kings of Pinot,
                            with California making some fuller, riper expressions, while
                            Oregon, with its cooler climate produces lighter more
                            quintessential examples (no shade intended on California,
                            it's just different.) When you look at a map Willamette Valley
                            in Oregon is on almost the same latitude as Burgundy, potentially
                            contributing to their similar character. Pinot Noirs are great food
                            wines because they're generally not bold enough to overpower the
                            flavors of whatever you're eating.

                            I love Grenache. Easy drinking light-medium bodied wines Grenache
                            is very versatile: great for food and sipping. Grenache from France
                            mostly comes from the Rhone region os southern France. It is generally
                            on the lighter side of medium, and fruity with notes of juicy berries
                            sometimes accompanied by a slight green undertone (like if someone
                            put a sprig of herb garnish in your cocktail). If it's from a
                            warmer climate, either a warmer region or just a warmer than average
                            growing season, Grenache can have heavier pepper notes, while cooler
                            examples are a bit more floral. In Spain Grenache is called Garnacha,
                            tends to be more solidly medium bodied than French versions and
                            usually has these peppery notes, Spanish Garnacha is one of the best
                            wines you can buy in the $10 range; unoaked varieties make
                            a killer Sangria.

                            Merlot was right up there with California Cabernet before Paul

                            like "I'm not drinking any [forking] Merlot!" Merlot is very
                            similar to Cabernet in many ways and is usually cheaper
                            to boot. It's not quite as intense as Cab but has many of
                            the same intense red, and purple, fruits, softer vanilla, and
                            espresso or mocha notes from the oak, with less intense pepper
                            (usually.) Additionally, because of its artificially tarnished
                            reputation quality Merlot is usually cheaper than similarly revered
                            Cab. Many people even think they're drinking a slight lighter bodied
                            Cab when you give them Merlot! So forget Sideways, if you like Cab,
                            find a quality bottle of California/Washington Merlot or Merlot
                            dominant Bordeaux Blends (ask the  clerk at your neighborhood wine

                            aka table wine (because it's cheaper to produce, cheaper wines from
                            Bordeaux are generally more heavily Bordeaux than Cab, but this is
                            not a rule.) Fun fact: the wine Paul Giamatti drinks at the end of
                            the movie, <em>Cheval Blanc,</em> is a revered Merlot based wine.

                            Sangiovese is the quintessential Italian wine grape. It’s a
                            medium bodied, very tannic grape that can have notes of cherry
                            or blackberry as well as spices as anise and licorice depending
                            on the style of production. Sangiovese is a, if not the, major
                            player in Tuscan red wines. Brunello di Montalcino is one of
                            the most sought after and highly regarding Italian wines and
                            is always (by law) 100% Sangiovese. Rosso di Montalcino,
                            Brunello’s little cousin is also 100% Sangiovese and Hannibal
                            Lecter’s favorite, Chianti, always has some amount of Sangiovese.
                            Although some modern styles of Sangiovese can be more fruit forward,
                            especially the odd one here or there you find from California,
                            or other places that are not Italy, they tend to be much earthier
                            with notes of earth, mushroom, and those barnyard,  gamey, Brettanomyces
                            funky flavors.

                              Nebbiolo is the other major heavy hitter in the Italian wine
                              world. In Italian wine, some people will tell you, it’s all about
                              the three B’s: Brunello (with is Sangiovese) and Barolo and
                              Barbaresco which are both made with Nebbiolo. Nebbiolo is
                              mostly closely associated with the Piedmont region in Northwestern
                              Italy. Nebbiolo is medium bodied with purple fruit notes such
                              as blackberry and plum. Like most Italian wines Nebbiolo wines
                              are usually in a more traditional style with that quintessential
                              old-world funk.Nebbiolo isn’t quite as acidic as Sangiovese but
                              it is also highly tannic. Italian wines can almost always benefit
                              from a moderate to significant amount of aging (think about ten
                              years, to start.) If you find that you like Barolo and Barbaresco,
                              but don’t like spending upwards of $50 for every bottle of wine, try
                              Langhe Nebbiolo, which is the same grape, from a slightly less
                              prestigious region. High quality producers of Barolo and
                              Barbaresco almost always also make Nebbiolo wines from Langhe,
                              and they have been called baby Barolos and Barbarescos, at
                              a much more palatable price.

                             Moving away from the French and Italian varietals
                             (finally) Tempranillo is a Spanish grape that makes
                             fuller bodied wines. Spain’s Rioja region is famous
                             for Tempranillo as it is the major component in these big
                             red wines. Tempranillo’s characteristics can change pretty
                             dramatically depending on how long it has been aged in oak
                             (Crianza has spent the least time in oak, Gran Reserva the most.)
                             If you want a spicy, smokey expression that will give good
                             California Cabernet a run for its money
                             (without the tendency towards sweet fruit, jammy overtones)
                             try a Rioja. Crianza Rioja will be a little brighter with
                             more dark cherries and even some berries coming through,
                             with a very slight green flavor, and woodsiness from the
                             brief oak aging. Other regions in the world grow Tempranillo
                             in small amounts, but the vast majority of my experience with
                             the grape is from Spain. I have had a handful of California
                             experiments and they are some funky, interesting wines,
                             but not necessarily for the faint of heart.

                           with oaky, vanilla, pepper and smoke notes, try a California Cab.
                           If you can't afford a good bottle from California (starting around $30)
                           try some from Argentina, Chile, or Washington State, where you can get a
                           similar style for $20 or less. Cabernet is the mostly widely planted
                           grape in the world because vintners can charge the most for them.

                           Sauvignon because it seems like everybody's dad drinks it. Cabernet
                           is what put California wine on the map (look up "The Judgement of Paris"

                           the five main grapes in Bordeaux: Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot,
                           Malbec, Cabernet Franc, and Petit Verdot) you'll get a much
                           less intense version than you find in the new world. Bordeuax
                           have a funky , gamey, "barnyard" flavor courtesy of a specific
                           yeast called Brettanomyces (aka Brett.) Usually Cabernet is way
                           too intense for me to have with food so I often sip on it while
                           cooking and will have something else while I'm eating.

                            You've probably seen the words Shiraz on a bottle of wine from Australia,
                            perhaps with a certain marsupial on the label. Syrah and Shiraz are the same
                            same grape. Syrah can be a big fruit and pepper bomb, a big
                            red-purple wine with earthy notes of olive and menthol or a
                            lighter medium bodied fruit forward wine, depending on where
                            it's grown. Australia is particularly known
                            for its Syrah, but don't let those big bottles of kangaroo
                            branded wine fool you; Syrah isn't meant to blow out your pallet,
                            and smaller producers in Australia have been working hard over
                            the last 10+ years to restore their reputation for quality that
                            was damaged when the market was flooded with these cheap big brands.
                            Washington State also makes some intense Syrah, usually on the
                            earthier end of the spectrum. Syrah is originally from France
                            (are you noticing a pattern here?) if you like a big, bold, fruity
                            wine you'll probably like Syrah, try some from Chile for a bargain
                            that doesn't compromise on quality, then see what Australia is
                            really made of when you're ready to spend a little more.

                             Full disclosure: half of my family is from Argentina, so
                             I have had more than my fair share of this grape. Malbec
                             is originally from Bordeaux, in France, but almost went
                             extinct before blowing up the Argentine wine scene. Malbec
                             can be a medium bodied wine, less intense than Cabernet, but
                             traditionally is a big purple wine. Malbec has gotten a
                             reputation as an easy, everyman, red wine, that is
                             perhaps not as intimidating as other red varietals.
                             In Argentina there are two main styles of Malbec:
                             fruity/jammy and smokey/earthy. All Malbec can have
                             notes of plum, blackberries, cassis and dark cherries.
                             Fruit-froward, jammy, styles may have milder vanilla
                             oak notes, whereas earthier versions will have definite
                             notes of dirt, wood, leather, and smoke. Depending on
                             how long the wine has been aged in oak it can have some
                             very strong black pepper notes. I find French Malbec,
                             aka Cot, to usually be lighter, more reserved in style,
                             compared to the Argentine versions; it’s more solidly
                             medium bodied, sometimes with more pronounced green notes,
                             and less bold spice, as can be expected from the cooler
                             growing climate. Usually it’s a bit player in Bordeaux
                             blends but you can find some interesting single varietals
                             from southern France.

                            People at the liquor store I used to work with called
                            this “Cougar Juice” because many women of a certain
                            age would drink this (lots of people I worked with were gross.)
                            Pinot Gris and Pinot Grigio are the same grape, one
                            is the French name the other, Italian, but both are
                            applied to productions from around the world. Pinot
                            Gris is generally used to describe a fruitier version
                            while wines using the name Pinot Grigio tend to be a
                            little greener and perhaps more mineral (like the ones
                            coming out of Italy.) That being said,
                            regardless of style Pinot Grigio is always light,
                            crisp, and easy drinking. It’s super refreshing on a
                            hot day but honestly, it’s not my favorite. That being said
                            I almost always have at least some Pinot Grigio if I’m
                            hosting a party because some people don’t really like Pinot Grigio,
                            but nobody really <em>hates</em> Pinot Grigio.

                            For some reason Riesling has gotten a reputation amongst
                            “people who know things about wine” as a secret star of the
                            wine world. I suppose it’s because it got a bad reputation
                            when the syrupy sweet versions were all everybody’s grandmother
                            drank. Now, whenever I try to recommend Riesling to someone,
                            their first reaction tends to be “Oh no, I don’t like sweet wine.”
                            <br><br>
                            Let’s get one thing straight: Not all Riesling is sweet.
                            When you see “wine-people” fawning over a Riesling they
                            may be compelled to specify “A good, dry, Riesling.” Dry
                            Rieslings from Germany will have the word “Trocken” on the
                            label to signify them as dry. That being said, Rieslings can
                            also make wonderful, sweet, dessert wines. If you’re looking for
                            something on the sweeter side look for the word “Auselese” or
                            “Spatlese” on the label. These words all, specifically, refer to
                            how ripe the grapes were when they were picked, but ripeness
                            denotes sweetness, so just go with it. Another cheat, although
                            this one is not a hard and fast rule, if you’re wondering if a
                            wine is sweet or not sweet, look at the alcohol content. Sugar
                            gets eaten by yeast during fermentation and its what is turned
                            into alcohol. The more alcohol in the wine, the fewer sugars will
                            be left, resulting in a drier wine. If you see an ABV under 8%,
                            that’s almost definitely a sweet wine,  drier versions will usually
                            fall upwards of 12%, with the semi-dry/semi sweet falling in between.
                            An off-dry Riesling (aka one with a smidge of sweetness) is hands down
                            my absolute favorite thing to eat with spicy thai food. They offer
                            notes of baked golden apples with an undercurrent of salinity, and a
                            robust acidity that will stand up to the strong flavors of the food.
                            Dry Rieslings can tend to be a little greener than this, with more
                            strong mineral notes and a sharp acidity, but the snobs are right, a
                            great dry Riesling is something to be cherished.

                            If you want a fruity, dry, mineral, white wine,
                            Sauvignon Blanc is your wine. Originally from France,
                            Sauvignon Blanc has really taken hold in the New Zealand
                            wine scene. New Zealand and American versions are defined
                            by their grapefruit and passion fruit flavors. I would
                            argue that American versions are slightly less intense
                            than their New Zealand counterparts, but they are both
                            going for the same profile. Depending on the quality,
                            these wines will also have some stoniness or minerality
                            to them to round out the complexity. French ones, such
                            as those from Sancerre, in the south of France, are
                            greener than their New World brethren, and although
                            they often times have some of the quintessential
                            grapefruit character, they also are accompanied
                            by sharper citrus fruits, like lemon and lime,
                            and can be straight up salty, waxy, and grungy
                            (if they’re really good.) If you’re just starting
                            to dip your toes into Sauvignon Blanc I would
                            start with a quality bottle from New Zealand
                            in the $12-15 range; if that turns out to be
                            juicy and fruit forward, try a similarly priced
                            bottle from the Loire region in France which will
                            have more of those green notes. If you’re ready for
                            something really different, plop down $30-$40 for a really
                            good, single vineyard version from Sancerre and get
                            ready for it to funk you up.

                            Chenin Blanc is a light-medium bodied white wine oftentimes with
                            notes of white peach, honeysuckle and lemon. The richer flavors
                            are usually cut with a fair amount of acidity, but the wines are a bit
                            heftier than the light styles of Pinot Grigio and Sauvignon
                            Blanc discussed above. The versions I find most often are Dry
                            or Off-Dry (with a small amount of residual sugar.)
                            Dry versions have a sharper acidity and can often have
                            mineral notes of stone, but not quite salty. Chenin Blanc is a
                            big big grape in South Africa’s wine country, and dry versions
                            from quality producers are some of the best values in white wine.
                            I love an off-dry Vouvray (a region in southern France) where the
                            small amount of sugar in the wine bring out the richer notes from
                            the floral honey suckle and the stone fruit without becoming heavy
                            and juicy. Chenin Blanc is one of those wines that might be best
                            found with a guiding hand as in America it’s still a bit off the
                            beaten path (although there are amounts of it grown in California
                            where the peach notes really shine thanks to the warmer growing temperatures)
                            so I would ask the shop attendant for a good recommendation if
                            you don’t know where to start.

                            Gewurztraminer is what we call an “aromatic white.” Riesling,
                            Viognier, and Pinot Gris also fall into this category (among others.)
                            All this means is that these wines have a chemical component called
                            terpenes, which release particularly strong aromas;
                            you will get lots of strong, floral, and fruit notes when
                            you shove your nose into a glass of Gewurz and sniff. The grapes
                            have a high concentration of sugar when ripe and are most commonly found
                            in an off-dry style, if not a full on sweet dessert wine. Gewurtraminer does
                            really well in cool climates (as does Riesling) so you will find a lot of
                            it in Germany, Austria, and the Alsace region of France
                            (which is right across the border from Germany and Austria.)
                            Gewürztraminer also does really well in, perhaps surprisingly
                            to you, upstate New York. The Finger Lakes region in New York State
                            makes some of the best cool-climate varietal wines in the United States,
                            and some of my personal favorites. If you find Riesling too acidic
                            for your taste, try a Gewürztraminer, they have many of the same
                            honey and cooked fruit notes, and pair equally well with spicy food.

                            Sémillon has a similar body to Chardonnay without the
                            tropic fruit notes warm weather expressions can have.
                            I wouldn't call Sémillon acidic, although all wines have acid,
                            but a rounder, sometimes waxier contender. Sémillon is often
                            found in white Bordeaux blends and when blended with Sauvignon
                            Blanc (which greatly ups the acid factor) you can get honey crisp
                            apple and other round fruit flavors. Australia makes some
                            interesting Sémillon as well, similar in style to their Chardonnays,
                            without quite as much ripeness, and the quintessential waxiness
                            running in the background.
                            <br><br>
                            Sémillon really stars as the main component in a famous French dessert
                            wine called Sauternes. Sauternes is produced when ripe Sémillon is
                            infected with a fungus called botrytis, aka noble rot. The mold
                            concentrates the sugary juices in the grapes such that when pressed,
                            the gold juice is almost like a thin syrup. Top Sauternes can cost
                            hundreds, if not thousands of dollars and can be aged for hundreds
                            of years, in the right conditions. Foie gras is the classic pairing
                            with Sauternes and definitely a choice if you want to go full-fancy
                            style. As a vegetarian, I cannot speak to it personally, but
                            I would say anything fatty, luscious and maybe a little stinky,
                            like a washed-rind triple creme brie, or buttery funky blue cheese,
                            would be delicious too.

                            I only recently started really getting into Viognier. It’s
                            another aromatic white wine, with a body similar to a Chardonnay,
                            but usually without strong oak aging. Viogniers have flavors of
                            peach, flowers, yellow apples and are sometimes subject to a process
                            called malolatic fermentation which can lead to fewer apple notes and
                            some distinct creamy, milky, notes (it always reminds me of
                            fruit-on-the-bottom peach yogurt.) Viognier is a low-acid grape
                            and is found abundantly in the white whine blends in the Northern
                            Rhone region of Southern France. Outside of France, Viognier has
                            really only started to take hold in the last 25 years or so.
                            Australia makes some really interesting Viogniers, and one of my
                            favorites, where I first encountered those weird peach yogurt vibes,
                            but the new hot kid on the street, getting all of the attention,
                            is Viognier coming out of Virginia, of all places.
                            <br><br>
                            I can’t talk about Viognier without mentioning Côte-Rôtie.
                            Côte-Rôtie is a region in France but also refers to the famous
                            blended red wine produced there. Côte-Rôtie is mostly Syrah but
                            is always blended with an amount of Viognier (up to 20%.)
                            The resulting wine is definitely a red wine which is interesting
                            because red and white grapes are very rarely blended together,
                            unless it’s to make a specific style of Rose. Viognier is used
                            in Côte-Rôtie to mellow the Syrah and also enhance the wine’s
                            color and aroma. Côte-Rôtie is what I would call an advanced
                            level wine, because you pretty much can’t find a bottle for
                            less than $50, if you’re lucky.

                            For some reason Chardonnay is such an incredibly polarizing
                            grape; to hear people talk you’d think it was the cilantro of
                            the wine world: you either love it or your hate it. I would
                            argue that the reality is more nuanced, and that a lot of
                            people who <em> think </em> they hate Chardonnay, can be
                            persuaded otherwise.
                            <br><br>
                            Chardonnay is about as full bodied as white wines come.
                            They can be aged in oak, but unoaked varieties are becoming
                            increasingly common (don’t tell Chablis: a region in Burgundy
                            in France that has been making purely unoaked Chardonnay for
                            centuries.) When people say they hate Chardonnay, generally
                            what they mean is they hate big, oaky, buttery, California
                            Chardonnay. The butteriness comes from a combination of
                            malolactic fermentation which lends itself to creamy,
                            milky, notes, and the oak aging which gives it an oiliness.
                            This kind of oaked Chardonnay can be really intense.
                            That coupled with notes of sweet, heavy, tropical fruits
                            like Pineapple, Papapya, Mano, and baked Apple, sometimes
                            without a strong acidic undertone, defines many of California's
                            offerings which some people <em>love</em> but can also, apparently,
                            incite violence in the hearts of many.
                            <br><br>
                            This is just <em>one</em> kind of Chardonnay. Fly across
                            the ocean to Burgundy (or just up the coast to Oregon,
                            or south to Argentina…you get it) you’ll find plenty of
                            other expressions of Chardonnay. Chablis is one example,
                            and probably my personal favorite. Chablis, and other
                            unoaked varieties are much fresher tasting than their
                            heavy oaky cousins; they have notes of green apple, pear,
                            unripe pit fruit, slate, and salt. The acidity in these wines
                            is more pronounced which allows the wine to feel lighter.
                            If your tastebuds are used to California Chardonnay,
                            they might not even recognize unoaked Chardonnay as
                            the same grape. Chablis can get expensive but try
                            an unoaked offering from Oregon, Argentina, or Australia
                            for something more cost effective, or look for a french
                            Chardonnay with the words “Macon-Villages” on it, the
                            villages level classification is a less prestigious one
                            than the legally designated growing region of Chablis,
                            but they almost never use oak, and clock in solidly under $15.
